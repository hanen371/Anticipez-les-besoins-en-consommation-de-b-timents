This is the 4th project carried out during my training in data science. The skills evaluated in this project are: 
- Adapt the hyperparameters of a supervised learning algorithm in order to improve it
- Transform the relevant variables of a supervised learning model
- Implement the supervised learning model adapted to the business problem
- Evaluate the performance of a supervised learning model
